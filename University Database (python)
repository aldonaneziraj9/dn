'''   There are two text files with the following information stored in them:
The instructor.txt file where each line stores the id, name and affiliated department of an instructor separated by a comma
The department.txt file where each line stores the name, location and budget of the department separated by a comma
You need to write a Python program that creates a university database with two tables - instructor and department.
The instructor table will have three columns - id, name and dept_name
The department table will have three columns - dept_name, location, budget.
Use appropriate type for the above attributes and also specify all relevant primary and foreign keys.
Your Python program will then read the two provided text files (instructor and department) and store the information from those files into their respective tables in the database.
You will now provide the user with the following menu:
1. Enter the instructor ID and I will provide you with the name of the instructor, affiliated department and the location of that department.
2. Enter the department name and I will provide you with the location, budget and names of all instructors that work for the department.
3. Insert a record about a new instructor.
4. Delete a record about an instructor
5. Exit
The above menu should continue to be displayed in a loop until the user selects option 5.
When the user selects option 1 above, the following should be displayed:
Enter the instructor ID:
If the user enters an instructor id that is not present in the database, display "The ID doesnot appear in the database.", otherwise, display the name of the instructor, affiliated department and the location of that department.
When the user selects option 2 above, the following should be displayed:
Enter the department name:
If the user enters a name that is not present in the database, display "The department name doesnot appear in the database.", otherwise, display the location, budget and names of all instructors that work for the department.
If the user selects option 3 above, display the following:
Enter the instructor id:
Enter the instructor name:
Enter the affiliated department name:
Once the user enters the above information, store the information in the instructor table only if the following two conditions are met: 1. The department already exists in the department table. If not, display "The department does not exist and hence the instructor record cannot be added to the database". 2. The instructor id should not already be present in the database. If so, display "Instructor id already exists in the database."
If the user selects option 4 above, display the following:
Enter the instructor id:
If the user entered id exists in the database, delete the information about that instructor from the database. If the id does not exist in the database, then display "The ID doesnot appear in the database."
If the user selects option 5, your loop should stop.   '''
